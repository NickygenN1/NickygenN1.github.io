    <h2 class="yel">What is Machine Learning ?</h2><br><br>
    <span>
    <strong>Machine learning </strong> gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed
    <br> It learn by many of data to find the pattern :<br>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
        - this picture is a cat or dog
        <br>- how bitcoin price next day (if i can do, i won't tell you)
        <br>- can cluster ralative data with other and seperate what is abnormal
        <br>- how many hour for study is get a best grade
        </p>
    </span>
    <span><br><br>
    <h3>Type of Machine Learning</h3><br>
    <p><strong>1. Supervised learning </strong>: have x predict y <br>
    - regression : predict the number(price of BTC in next monday, what grade if i study 1 hour per day) <br>
    - classification : categorical (this is picture of cat or dog)</p><br>
    <p>
   <strong>2. Unsupervised learning</strong> : have only x (find relative of x)
    <br>- clustering : i want group of 3 of customer that have somthing relative.
    <br>- non-clustering : what is abnormal from the other   
    </p><br>

    <p>for more ML has Reinforcement learning : reward and punish, computer learn to get the most reward (alphago learn to play go for million time a day)</p>
